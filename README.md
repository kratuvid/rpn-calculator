# Simple Calculator
Arbitrary length calculator or something

# Todo
- [ ] arbitrary precision numbers
- [ ] fixed and decimal numbers
- [ ] optimized loops ) proper scoped loops, still "unoptimized"
- [ ] 'var' set variables in the previous scope if not present in the current
- [x] unoptimized loops
- [x] function local variables ) pop locals on error
- [x] comments
- [x] move operations member variable to map
- [x] optimize variable deletion by deleting from the last? - removed
- [x] separate parsing, syntax checking and execution
- [x] enter number of items returned on an operation/function - not needed
- [x] check if the required no of function arguments are in the stack
- [x] functions can't have the same name as operations - not needed, they can
- [x] check for the existence of the variable after parsing - removed
- [x] check the type of exceptions throw is correct with their type
- [x] should we substitue variables when put into stack - yes
